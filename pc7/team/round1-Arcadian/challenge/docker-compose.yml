    ## Background
    
    🎨 As an art and history enthusiast, you encounter a new digital exhibition while touring the Palace of Heracles. Before you can ask about the mysterious laptop on the podium, your tour guide explains that only those with a taste for `Arcadian` (rustic) art are 'chosen' to complete the challenge. You are then guided to the laptop and the rest of the tour attendees patiently watch you engage in this one-of-a-kind experience.

    In this challenge, you must reverse a `Rust` binary, discover its hidden tokens, and earn the adoration of the greater art community.

    ## Getting Started

    **Downloading The Exhibit**
    To get started, simply navigate to the Arcadian website and download the binary to your preferred operating system to begin the journey.

    **Permissions Issues**
    If you get an Access Denied message when executing the binary, simply run the following command to activate it:
    `chmod +x arcadian`
    
    **Tokens**  
    Initially, you will find the binary does not readily provide tokens for successful actions:

    ```text
    e.g. ✅ TOKEN1: <VALUE>
    ```

    **This is intended by the artist.**  

    You must use your knowledge of reverse engineering functions to extract `tokens` from the binary in a creative way.

    **Stages/Acts**  
    Any team member can jump directly to a specific stage by running the binary with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./arcadian --stage [1,2,3,4,5]
    ```

    This will take you directly to a specific stage at any time.

    **XOR-Shift Algorithm**
    An XOR-Shift in this context is defined as incrementing the position of a byte by one. Please view the example below for clarity:

    ```text
    Base XOR Key: 0xA1
    Word: APPLE

    A would be XOR'd with 0xA1
    P would be XOR'd with 0xA2
    P would be XOR'd with 0xA3
    L would be XOR'd with 0xA4
    E would be XOR'd with 0xA5
    ```
    
    ## Objectives
    * Find the fragmented token 
    * Complete the Dynamic Pointer Maze via automation or reverse-engineering.
    * Capture the memory of the binary (in a timely manner) 
    * Examine the misconfigured logic behind an application error.
    * Decrypt ciphertext using an XOR-shift algorithm
