[--- Nautical Rapid Response Team Training Day ---]

Welcome, Recruit.

Your task is to complete a series of forensic operations:
1. Recover deleted files from a disk image (disk_image.dd).
3. Analyze system logs for tampering and hidden messages (syslog.log).
3. Examine live memory for hidden processes and secrets (memory_dump.raw).
4. Examine a packet capture with suspicious voice based activity (suspicious_capture.pcap).

Submit your findings by extracting the hidden tokens.

Good luck, Recruit.
