[--- CODE OSIRIS ---]

Welcome, Recruit.

Your mission is to follow in the footsteps of Dante Haroshi and execute the perfect breach:

[--- MISSION 1 (TOKEN1) ---]
1. Retrieve the file 'code_osiris_v1' from `http://lab.yara.hq` (HQ).
2. Use fuzzers or python to crash the binary and identify the vulnerable field.
3. Find the offset required to take control of the binary's execution flow.
4. Complete the exercise.


[--- MISSION 2 (TOKEN2) ---]
1. From HQ download `code_osiris_v2` which repeats this exercise but features multiple fields for exploitation and reverse engineering execution.
2. On execution, the app binary details the tasking.
3. Once you have achieved the desired outcome (correcting execution flow to the secret() function), TOKEN2 will be revealed.

[--- MISSION 3 (TOKEN3) ---]

1. Navigate to TCP port 9999 at lab2.yara.hq using your preferred communication tool (netcat, etc.)
2. Conduct a training exercise using the CODE OSIRIS REMOTE EXPLOIT TRAINER. 
2. Exploit the BOF feature to gain an understanding of how to remotely exploit a buffer overflow.

[--- FINAL MISSION (TOKEN4) ---]

[--- 🔴 OPERATION BLUE SANDS ---]

Now that you are fluent with buffer overflows and have successfully fixed Code_Osiris; we have a special mission just for you:

OBJECTIVES
1. Reach ABYSSNET - we have the IP of the facility but not the port associated with the LAUNCH service.

[*] DEEPCOM Facility (ABYSSNET) :
    - Hostname: abyssnet.dbs
    - Port: TCP/UNKNOWN

2. Scan the server to determine the port on which ABYSSNET is loaded.
3. Interact with the application to gain a better understanding of it's root functionality.
4. Determine a vector of potential exploitation.
5. Enter the "key" (or exploit) into the LAUNCH feature of ABYSSNET.
6. Await further instructions.


[--- TEMPLATES ---]
Several templates and tools are provided in the HQ Web Portal. They are not required for success however, they may help guide you in a more expedient manner.
Time is of the essence you know...


[--- CLOSING ---]

Think of the "tokens" you recieve throughout this exercise as badges of courage.

Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

No pressure; seems like a lot of people are depending on you 😇.
